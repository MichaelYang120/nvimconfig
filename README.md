## Inspiration
- [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ENHE5xdFSwx71u3fDH5Xw)
https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua

this setup is based on primeagen's setup with some modifications and added plugins and keybindings, this is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about neovim and lua
I added this to my repo so I can easily sync my config across multiple machines
